# Developing Logistic Regression Algorithm From Scratch

Here i show Logistic Regression can be developed from scratch. Firstly Logistic regression is a generalized linear model that we can use to model or predict cases where the target variable is categorical by type. So simply put Logistic Regression Models are Classification models. They are used to predict the category or class an element or entity falls into. For the case where we have to classify a set of variables into two classes we call that Binary Classification Problem. For binary classification case the model(in this case Logistic Regression) predict the target variable by producing outputs of 0 when it belongs to a class and 1 when it belongs to the other class.

## Approximations
Logistic Regression function is derived from the transformation of a Linear Regression function using what is known as a sigmoid function.
